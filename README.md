# Replication_Materials

This repository contains replication materials for submitted and published manuscripts. The files are created in Quarto using R. I recommend cloning the repository first, then examining the analysis using the html file. This directory also contains a renv lock file that creates a fully reproducible environment, read more [here](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). 

Please reach out if you have any questions.
