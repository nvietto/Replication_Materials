* Analyses(09-23-24).html : This is a user-friendly HTML file that contains all steps, code, justifications, and results of the analyses. It is completely interactive and can be viewed in any web browser, just download the file and open it. **This is the best file to view for a comprehensive understanding of the analyses.**

* Analyses(09-23-24).qmd : This file contains the Quarto file with all the R code. It is the same file as the HTML file, but it is difficult to navigate.  

* data2.csv : This is the data file used for the analyses. It contains the data for the study.

**Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Data Notes:**

* *Baseline*: In the HR and SC measures, we excluded zero values during the first 11 seconds and the final 30 seconds of analysis, as these likely resulted from random hand movements by participants during the phases.

* *Task*: In the HR measures for each stress paradigm, a small number of individuals had zero values in random columns (typically 1-4 columns or seconds). These zeros likely resulted from minor, random hand movements during the task. While the data appeared to be missing completely at random (MCAR), which would justify excluding these cases, we chose to retain them to maximize sample size. Zero values were replaced by the mean of the values from the second before and the second after the zero.
