**Differences in Associations Between Autonomic Nervous System Activity and Psychopathic Traits Across Stress Paradigm and Measures**

Autonomic Nervous System (ANS) Data Notes:

These modifications were applied only to the HR measures.

**Baseline**: In the HR measures, we excluded zero values during the first 11 seconds and the final 30 seconds of analysis, as these likely resulted from random hand movements by participants during the phases.

**Task**: In the HR measures for each stress paradigm, a small number of individuals had zero values in random columns (typically 1-4 columns or seconds). These zeros likely resulted from minor, random hand movements during the task. While the data appeared to be missing completely at random (MCAR), which would justify excluding these cases, we chose to retain them to maximize sample size. Zero values were replaced by the mean of the values from the second before and the second after the zero.
